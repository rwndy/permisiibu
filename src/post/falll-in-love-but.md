This is my story. I met this girl at the cafe. But, I don't remember when I met this girl.
But, after that I met her, day after day, I like this girl.

And now, gradually falling in love with Her. Every night before I want to sleep. I always think of Her. her face, her laugh, her smile are in my mind. I do not know. I can't handle this feeling.

I'm so confused by this feeling. Sometimes this feeling makes me happy and sometimes it makes me sad and confused.

I fell in love with Her but.. she didn't. Maybe it's been taken. Arrrrgfh I don't know.
